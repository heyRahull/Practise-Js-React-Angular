// Exercise: Variables & Operators
// To practice what you learned, complete the following task:

// Create two variable or constants, a and b, that should store the values 5 and 3 respectively. Thereafter, also add a third variable or constant, sum, that stores the sum of a and b.

// You don't have to do anything else with those variables / constants.

// Important: For the automatic solution checking to work, make sure you use exactly the variable / constant names a, b and sum!

// Todo: Your solution code goes here ...
const a = 5;
const b = 3;
const sum = a+b;
